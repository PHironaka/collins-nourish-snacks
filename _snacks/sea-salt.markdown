Seashells, sea glass, sea breeze...we love the ocean. That's why our founder & nutritionist, Joy Bauer, made these Sea Salt Ancient Grain Crisps using whole grain sorghum, quinoa, millet, brown rice, chia & hemp seeds. Once your friends try 'em, the seagulls won't be the only ones chasing you for your snacks.
