Licking your fingers is the only way to clean up after eating BBQ. You'll feel the same when you try these Texas BBQ Ancient Grain Crisps. Our founder & nutritionist, Joy Bauer, made them with purposeful ingredients like whole grain sorghum, quinoa, millet, brown rice, chia & hemp seeds. All the smoky, sweet BBQ flavor you crave. None of the I-need-to-unbutton-my-pants feeling.
