Power through a grueling workday—and meet demanding deadlines with ease—by eating these 7 heroic superfoods. Ready…set…snack.

**1. Greek Yogurt**

Protein-packed, potassium-rich, and probiotic-charged (say that five times fast!), Greek yogurt will fill your tank with high-octane fuel. Top it off with a brain-boosting bag of [Nourish Snacks Blueberry Apple](/snacks/blueberry-apple/) for added texture, and sweet, guilt-free spoonfuls.

**2. Chickpeas**

These legumes contain BEAN-e-ficial fiber and protein to help you recharge and refresh. Big Bonus: Crunchy foods are effective stress-relievers!

**3. Almonds**

This NUT-worthy overachiever contains a trifecta of protein, fiber and healthy fats to help steady your blood sugar and provide long-lasting staying power. 

**4. Chia Seeds**

Chow down on chia to stimulate your smarts. This superfood supplies, protein, soluble fiber, and omega-3 fats. Try any of [our snacks](/snacks/) for the delicious chia power your brain desires.

**5. Coffee**

Skip the pricey energy drinks and stick with coffee. A cup o’ Joe contains more caffeine than a Red Bull (who knew?!) and it provides healthy antioxidants for far fewer calories. Unless you’re caffeine-sensitive, sipping coffee is a great way to put some pep in your step. Turned off by the taste? Drink two cups of tea to match coffee’s caffeine quota.

**6. Dark Chocolate**

Joy Bauer describes dark chocolate as “happiness on steroids.” This regal ingredient has antioxidants and feel-good powers, allowing it to be both indulgent and guilt-free. Happily luxuriate in one of our three chocolate granola bites: [Chocolate Banana](/snacks/chocolate-banana/), [Chocolate-Peanut Butter](/snacks/chocolate-peanut-butter/), or [Double Chocolate](/snacks/double-chocolate/)!

**7. Apples**

This flavorful fruit deserves a round of APPLE-ause. Crunch away to regulate your blood sugar, increase your fiber intake, lower LDL cholesterol levels, and satisfy your sweet tooth. Snack on our [Blueberry Apple granola bites](/snacks/blueberry-apple/) and make 3 pm the crescendo of your day.
