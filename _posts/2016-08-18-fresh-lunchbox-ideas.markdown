We know how picky kids can be when it comes to school lunches and how tired us parents can get of packing them. So as you gear up for the school year, here are a few fun ideas to make this daily task a bit more interesting for everyone in the family.

**SUPED-UP SANDWICHES**   
Try these ideas for next-generation sandwiches that are fun to make, and even more fun to eat.

1. Cookie cutters aren’t just for cookies anymore. Use the fun shapes and cutouts to turn your boring old sandwich into a star (literally!)

2. Wrap it up! Kids love finger foods, so roll up a stack of turkey, cheese, and lettuce on a whole grain tortilla wrap and slice them into bite-sized pieces

3. You can also serve up chicken or turkey sausages on a whole grain roll. Bonus: some brands come packaged with produce like spinach, peppers and apple.

**RIDE THE RAINBOW**  
Getting little ones to eat fruits and vegetables can seem like a herculean task, but when you entice them with all the pretty colors, you may be pleasantly surprised. Mesmerize your kiddos with rainbow-rich produce picks.

1. Red: Strawberries, cherry tomatoes and sweet red bell pepper slices

2. Orange: Carrot sticks, clementines and juicy mango chunks

3. Yellow: Bananas and yellow pepper sticks

4. Green: Crunchy sugar snap peas, steamed string beans, granny smith apples and green grapes

5. Blue: Fresh blueberries and blackberries

6. Purple: Purple grapes, roasted purple potato wedges and plums
 
**MASON JAR PARFAITS**  
Looking for ways to use all those mason jars you stocked up on? Look no further than a portable yogurt parfait, which is perfect for a protein pick-me-up with lunch. Low-fat plain yogurt makes the perfect base; loaded with protein and calcium, and lower in sugar. Layer on a few substantial sweets and your kids will be singing your praises (along with your friends on Instagram!). Here’s a few tasty combos: 

1. Chopped strawberries, sliced banana and whole grain cereal

2. Coconut flakes and granola (or save the hassle and throw in some [Coconut Vanilla](/snacks/coconut-vanilla/) granola bites)

3. Blueberries and toasted sunflower seeds

4. Pineapple, mango, kiwi, chia seeds

5. Joy’s <a href="http://www.joybauer.com/healthy-recipes/cherry-chia-jam/" target="_blank">Cherry-chia jam</a> and a sprinkling of dark chocolate chips
 
**PACK A SNACK**  
Skip cookies and chips, and instead try some of these creative snack spins.

1. Homemade trail mix with dried fruit, whole grain cereal, and pumpkin seeds

2. Joy’s <a href="http://www.joybauer.com/healthy-recipes/parmesan-popcorn/" target="_blank">Parmesan popcorn</a> satisfies kids’ cheesy craving while delivering a handful of whole grains

3. Yogurt tubes are a fun way to bring yogurt on the go. (<a href="http://siggisdairy.com/product/blueberry-tubes/" target="_blank">Siggi's</a> is delicious and low in sugar)

4. Nourish Snacks' granola bites come in flavors kids love like [Chocolate Banana](/snacks/chocolate-banana/) and [Blueberry Apple](/snacks/blueberry-apple/). Nourishing and delicious ingredients guaranteed!
