The days are getting shorter and the nights are getting colder. Your couch probably looks like the best place on earth, and the last thing you want to do is go outside. We get it.  But did you know that it’s even more important for your health to stay active outdoors during winter? Leaving the comfort of your home for more than your commute to work or the grocery store will not only keep you fit, but will also help to better your mood and help you get some much needed vitamin D!

We came up with six great ways to get outside and enjoy the wintertime.

**Plan a ski trip**

Grab some of your friends and take a weekend trip to the mountains! Be sure to stay bundled so you can enjoy one of our favorite ways to get moving that doesn’t feel like exercise. Try websites like <a href="http://www.skivermont.com/deals" target="_blank">skivermont.com</a> or <a href="http://www.liftopia.com" target="_blank">liftopia.com</a> to find great ski package deals before you hit the slopes.

**Visit holiday markets**

Get in the holiday spirit by sipping hot cocoa as you walk through your local holiday market. Sprinkled with twinkle lights and festive decor, this activity will have you feeling warm and fuzzy in no time. Added bonus?  You’ll get in those extra steps.

**Take a long walk with family, friends, and out-of-town visitors**

If holiday shopping isn’t your thing, soak in the winter weather with a 20-30 minute brisk walk outdoors that will awaken your senses and leave you feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day. Have family visiting? Ask them to bring comfortable clothing and a pair of sneakers (and a few extra layers) so you can enjoy the walk together. When you get home, treat yourself to a hot cup of tea by the fire.

**Go ice-skating**

This is one of our favorite wintertime activities and we highly encourage you to get out on the rink even if you’re a newbie. There’s nothing more liberating than going round and round in circles in the cool air with a smile plastered on your face. And who knows? Maybe you’ll learn a trick or two (Triple Salchow anyone?). Grab your significant other for a romantic evening under the stars, or your friends and family for a Sunday afternoon activity. Attention first-timers: invest in a pair of wrist guards. Trust us, you’ll need them!

**Holiday “fun run” or walk**

If you missed your town’s Turkey Trot, there’s still a chance to participate in the group running action. Sign up for a holiday “fun run” and reap all the benefits of wearing Santa costumes and holiday outfits as you walk or run through your neighborhood. Benefits include: an excuse to buy a Mrs. or Mr. Claus outfit, your next most-liked Instagram, a stacked bagel at the finish, and of course that juicy runner’s high we all love.

**Looking for a more relaxing outdoor activity?**

Take a cozy blanket and sit outside on your porch with a hot mug of mulled cider and a bag of a holiday favorite, [Double Chocolate](/snacks/double-chocolate/). The cold air and yummy treats might just fuel you up for an impromptu snowball fight!
