An exciting revelation is poppin’ off, and we just can’t wait for you to dig in. We think there’s a grain of truth to the saying ‘everything old is new again’ but don’t be salty if you don’t get what we’re hinting at right away.  It’s kind of a cheesy riddle anyway.

Drum roll please…
They’re chock full o’ nutrient-rich ingredients. They’re so freaking delicious. They’re the greatest thing since…granola bites.

**Presenting: Nourish Snacks’ Popped Ancient Grain Crisps!(link)**

Salty snack lovers, rejoice! We’ve heard you loud and clear, and we’re so psyched to reveal that FINALLY we’re an equal opportunity snack provider.

Sea Salt.  
White Cheddar.  
Texas BBQ.  
It’s impossible to decide which one to tear open first, areweright? (Trust us, this has been a hot debate topic in the Nourish office as of late).

We dare you to go back to movie theater popcorn once you’ve tried <a href="/snacks/sea-salt/" target="_blank">Sea Salt</a>.  

<a href="/snacks/white-cheddar/" target="_blank">White Cheddar</a>? Let’s be honest, cheese makes everything taste amazing.  

And <a href="/snacks/texas-bbq/" target="_blank">Texas BBQ</a>. Let’s just say that our founder and nutritionist, Joy Bauer, has been working on the seasoning for over 2 years and, boy, did she nail it.

The best part? These snacks are made with purposeful ingredients like whole grain sorghum, quinoa, millet, brown rice, chia and hemp seeds (head over to our product pages to see why each ingredient serves a purpose). As always, these snacks are made with high-quality, nutrient-rich ingredients that also taste INCREDIBLE.

Trust us, these Popped Ancient Grain Crisps are the bomb. We’re so excited to finally share them with all of you, and we can’t wait to hear what you think. So dig in & en-JOY!
