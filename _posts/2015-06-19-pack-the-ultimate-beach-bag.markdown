You’ve made time to spend a sunny day at the beach. There’s no reason you should get hungry, thirsty, sunburned, or bored while you’re there. Be the prepared for the best and worst beach scenarios with our guide to packing the ultimate beach bag.

**Protect Your Skin:** Sunscreen and a hat are a must if you’re spending the day in the sun. While you may think that sunscreen is enough, a wide-brimmed hat covers places where it might be difficult to apply, like the scalp, as well as places where people often forget to apply, like the tops of the ears and the back of the neck. A hat also protects your eyes and keeps you from squinting in the sun.

**Perfectly-Portioned Snacks:** Keep an emergency snack stash so you won’t fall prey to greasy beach-shack grabs. Pack real foods like light popcorn and trail mix in portion-controlled baggies (or pre-portioned [Nourish Snacks](/snacks/) and cap each snack at 200 calories. If you have a cooler, consider baby carrots and hummus, whole grain pita with peanut butter, and Greek yogurt with berries.

**Stay Hydrated:** On a hot summer day, staying hydrated is key for your energy and your health. On the other hand, there’s nothing quite like taking a big gulp of lukewarm water. Yuck! Water bottles like <a href="https://www.swellbottle.com/" target="_blank">S’Well Bottles</a> keep your water ice cold for up to 24 hours.

**A Good Book:** Whatever your definition of a “beach read”- romance, mystery, or memoir- you’ll find it on this list of <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/work-life/entertainment/best-beach-reads" target="_blank">20 beach reads</a>.

**Get Your Sweat On:** Just because you’re at the beach, it doesn’t mean that you have to skip your workout. Have fun with it and bring a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pacific-Sports-SBS-1-Smashball-Set/dp/B0017KT8UU" target="_blank">Smashball</a> set or a football to toss around.

**Jam Out:** Make a playlist to set the mood. Spending a day with the kids? Bring their favorite songs for impromptu dance parties! With a group of friends? Set the tone with upbeat hits. Enjoying a romantic day by the sea? Cue the loves songs. Either play music on your smartphone or get a bluetooth speaker for better sound quality. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NudeAudio-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Compatible-Guarantee/dp/B00N4OT2BC/" target="_blank">This one</a> is waterproof and sand-proof.

**Keep It Clean:** From watermelon juice to ketchup to sticky bug spray, hands of all sizes can get messy. Bring wipes to clean up your beach-day mess.

**Just In Case:** Keep a small pre-built or homemade first aid kit with Band Aids, gauze, antiseptic wipes/gel, aloe, and Ibuprofen for any summer mishaps.
