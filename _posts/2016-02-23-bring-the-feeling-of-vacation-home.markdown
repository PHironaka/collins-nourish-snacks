Vacations are wonderful for a variety of reasons, but the feeling of relaxation that you bring home after a few days away can be magical. Unfortunately, that feeling tends to slip away as soon as you fall back into your daily routine. Answering emails, car pools, and grocery shopping trips don’t quite have the same effect as lounging on the beach with a piña colada.

The relaxation we feel on vacation doesn’t just come from the serene location, it’s also a result of unplugging from the rest of the world, even if just for a little while. Although that isn’t necessarily realistic day to day, there are a few things you can do in your every day routine when you return home from spring break to experience that “vacation feeling” at home.

**1. Relaxing activities:** While on vacation, you’re more inclined to take nightly walks on the beach at sunset or practice morning yoga before breakfast. At home, that time is generally reserved for getting ready for work, watching TV, or putting the kids to bed. Once or twice a week, take a walk with your partner, family, a friend, or your dog. Or try setting your alarm clock 10 minutes earlier and running through a few sun salutations. These practices are not only relaxing but you’ll get a chance to connect like real humans without screens or distractions.

**2. Vitamin D:** Part of the reason that vacation feels so good is all that Vitamin D. Most of us have to spend weekdays indoors, so it’s tough to get outside on a regular basis. To reap the benefits of Vitamin D, try taking drops in your breakfast, or if it’s possible where you live, aim to soak up some rays every single day, even if for 5 minutes. Leave the office or your house, take a walk, or just stand there. It can make a world of difference in your day.

**3. Move your body every day:** While work and daily activities tend to be more sedentary (aka sitting for hours in front of a computer), finding time to work out can be tough. On vacation, we’re more inclined to work out every day and our bodies thank us by sending lots of happy little endorphins into our blood stream. Back at home, you can do some form of physical activity every day. Whether that’s leg lifts while you’re cooking dinner, a brisk afternoon walk during your lunch break, or 10 sit ups in the morning and right before bed, make it happen daily for a week and see how much better you feel!

**4. Less electronics:**  Staring at a bright, stimulating screen for hours every day is not great for our brains and certainly not great for people with anxiety and/or sleep issues. Aim to shut down all electronics (yes that includes your smartphone!) at least one hour before bed. Read a book, sip on a cup of tea, or relax in anyway that works for you…without a screen.
