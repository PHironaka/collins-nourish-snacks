Some people seem to be able to eat whatever they want without gaining an ounce. We know their secret: portion control. (As for those people who can eat whatever they want… in copious amounts, it remains an envious mystery.)

Here’s the good news: Portion control is a skill that anyone can learn and eventually do subconsciously. And once you’ve mastered it, it’s pretty darn empowering, because nothing’s off-limits—including starchy carbs, pizza and ice cream.

Hooked? Read on.

**UNDERSTAND YOUR CALORIE NEEDS**

In order to figure out your personal portions at meals, you’ll first need to calculate your daily calorie requirement. Crunch your numbers with our [super easy formula](/posts/the-truth-about-calories/). Then divvy up your daily calorie allotment (AKA, fuel) throughout the day into meals and snacks.

Example:

1,600 calories/day = 3 meals (about 400-500 calories each) + 1-2 snacks (200 calories or less per snack).

**USE VISUAL CUES TO PERFECT PORTIONS**

Here’s a handy reference (hah, get it?) for portioning a wide variety of foods.

Bonus: Each of our snacks tells you how many snack bites you're allotted in 1 serving. We're all about mindful snacking!
