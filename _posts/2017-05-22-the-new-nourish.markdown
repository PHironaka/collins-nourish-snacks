Not to worry. You don’t need glasses. You haven’t navigated to the wrong website. You are indeed gazing at the new Nourish Snacks. Pretty different, huh? Here’s why:

Let’s be honest, when you walk through the grocery store, the snack aisle is filled with hundreds of options that all look the same. But Nourish Snacks has a different story to tell. Led by our founder and Registered Dietitian, Joy Bauer (you may recognize her as the health and nutrition expert on a little program called NBC’s TODAY Show), we let our ingredients and their nutritional benefit do the talking. Our snacks are bold, playful, and super delicious. With the belief that flavor and nourishment are created equal, we create snacks that strike a balance between sound nutrition and the deliciousness people want and deserve. We just want you to be able to truly enjoy your snack break (be it 30 seconds or 10 minutes) by giving you the best of both worlds.

This philosophy comes to life in a new design that is fun, vibrant, and upbeat, because we’re all about bringing the fun back to wellness! Our goal was to create a snack that people want to live with every day - on the kitchen counter, in your desk drawer, watching television, in the center console of your car. A snack that becomes an accessory to your everyday life, triggering a smile, and sparking conversation.

We’ve now ensured that the packaging outside is as delicious as the snacks inside. Take a gander down the snack aisle next time you’re at the store. You won’t be able to miss us.
