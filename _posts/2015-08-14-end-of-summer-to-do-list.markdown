The summer is winding down and we’re savoring the end of the season by checking a few fun-in-the-sun activities off of our to-do lists.

**1. Take an outside workout class.** From bootcamps on the beach to yoga classes in the park to Zumba in the streets, outdoor exercise groups have popped up everywhere this summer! Try a class for yourself before working out inside is your only option.

**2. Host an end of summer BBQ.** Before everyone starts hunkering down in the fall, invite over friends and family for an afternoon of grilling and enjoying each other’s company.

**3. Try stand-up paddle boarding.** This new water trend is harder than it looks! While paddle boarding tones your core, arms, and legs it doesn’t feel like a workout because it’s so much fun.

**4. Cook with seasonal ingredients.** Enjoy refreshing watermelon, sweet corn, luscious tomatoes, and flavorful basil before they go out of season.

**5. Enjoy an outside concert.** Whether it’s your favorite artist, the philharmonic, or a local band, there’s something exciting about live music outside. Enjoy it while it still lasts!
