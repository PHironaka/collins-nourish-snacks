The crisp, cool fall air will soon be upon us. Let the changing season be a time to focus on YOU. Follow these three simple steps to feel refreshed and rejuvenated.

**1) Season your menu**
Take advantage of fall’s bounty at every meal. Blend beets into your favorite breakfast smoothie; purée roasted butternut squash into a tasty soup; sauté Brussels sprouts with crispy turkey bacon for a comforting side dish; or poach Bosc pears and drizzle with balsamic vinegar for a delicious dessert.

**2) Enjoy the fresh air**
Kick-start your day with an invigorating morning run; enjoy the colorful foliage on a family hike; test your navigational skills at a local corn maze; or pick the perfect pumpkin with your little ones.

**3) LOL** 
Literally laugh out loud at least three times daily. You burn 20% more calories during a bout of the giggles, while boosting your mood and bringing enjoyment to your day.
