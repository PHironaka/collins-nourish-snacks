These yummy, bite-sized balls of chewy chocolate banana granola have won the hearts of the young and the old, jokesters and sophisticates, hipsters and cowboys. So if you haven’t tried them yet, we’re pretty sure our chewy Chocolate Banana granola bites are just your style.

We start with oats and crisp brown rice – two badass fiber-rich whole grains, which help to lower LDL (aka “bad”) cholesterol and prevent digestive illnesses like colon cancer. Then we sprinkle in chia seeds for omega-3 fats acids and some more fiber. Add in lots of naturally sweet, dried banana pieces, which deliver a hit of potassium – a key nutrient for controlling blood pressure.

Finally, we toss in cacao-rich chocolate. Aside from making you feel like you’re eating dessert, cacao contains flavanols. Flava-what? Powerful antioxidants that help calm inflammation, lower blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, prevent blood clots, and make your blood vessels more flexible, prevent blood clots, make your blood vessels more flexible, and lower blood pressure and LDL cholesterol. 

Judging on both taste and nutrition (and just overall awesomeness), we give [Chocolate Banana](/snacks/chocolate-banana/) two thumbs up.
