Want to know one of the easiest weight-loss secrets? Two words: Portion. Control.

You may be used to the enormous portions doled out in restaurants and even featured in cookbooks, but it wasn’t always like this. For instance, portions in the famous book, The Joy of Cooking have grown more than 60 percent since it was published in the 1930s. These oversized servings have trained us to expect more on our plates—and also to eat more. It’s no wonder many of us struggle with weight.

**Here are 4 tips to keep your portions in check:**

**1. Get a two-for-one benefit at restaurants.** Order half portions when dining out, if possible. If not, ask the waiter to wrap half of a full portion in a doggy bag before even bringing your dish to the table. That way, you can reheat the leftover portion the next day for lunch.

**2. Downsize dishes.** When you eat at home, serve your meals on smaller plates. Appropriate portions will look more substantial on smaller dishes, and you’ll likely be satisfied with less food.

**3. Snack smarter.** Pour snacks from larger packages into a small bowl before eating. You’ll consume less than if you had munched right out of the bag. Or go for portion-controlled snacks—either homemade (whip up a trail mix and divide into small zip-top bags) or store-bought (like your favorite flavor of [Nourish Snacks](/snacks/), which are all under 200 calories).

**4. Cook smaller.** Incorporate portion control into your meals by making meatloaf and frittatas in muffin tins (try Joy’s <a href="http://www.joybauer.com/healthy-recipes/mini-turkey-meatloaves/" target="_blank">Turkey Meatloves</a>).
