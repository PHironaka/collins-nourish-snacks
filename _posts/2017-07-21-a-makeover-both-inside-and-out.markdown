If you hadn’t noticed, back in May we debuted our new threads. We’ve given our packaging a facelift, if you will—a new design that’s vibrant, upbeat, and whole lot of fun. But that’s not the only thing that’s  changed. The snacks themselves have also gotten a makeover—we’ve made them more delicious and used cleaner ingredients, making them even harder to put down. In the spirit of transparency, we want to share exactly what’s changed and why. We crafted these snacks with you, our loyal snackers, in mind—so grab a bag and read on.
 

**Sticking to Our Roots**  
When we say we’ve given our snacks a “makeover,” what we mean is that we’ve added or changed just a few ingredients to make them even tastier and better for you. But you can still rip open a bag and feel good knowing that we’re sticking to our roots and are continuing to use high-quality, purposeful and nutrient-rich ingredients, like whole grain oats, banana, chocolate, coconut, blueberry and apples. This focus on wholesome ingredients makes us who we are, and you can rest assured we will never stray from that. Here’s a snapshot of what has changed:  

**Fruit Pectin**  
We now use fruit pectin as a natural binding agent to keep all the yummy ingredients together. Fruit pectin is made from dried citrus peels, like oranges, lemons and limes, has no taste, and even adds a little fiber. In the past, we used agave inulin and tapioca starch, two other natural binders. Why the change? We (and you) noticed that some of our granola bites (ahem, Blueberry Apple) broke apart easily. And a granola bite is not a granola bite if it’s broken into pieces! So Joy took to the kitchen, tried swapping in fruit pectin, and found that it improved the texture and consistency of our bites. Plus, she was able to reduce the overall sugar content—a nice bonus.  

**Chia Seeds**  
Chia: Once a seed you sprouted on terra cotta animals and even presidents’ heads, the ingredient has recently taken the healthy eating landscape by storm! And with good reason: They are superstar seeds, filled with plant-based omega-3 fats and fiber. They’d previously made an appearance only in our Coconut Vanilla bites, but they are now featured in all of our granola bite flavors. Incorporating these “nutrition sprinkles,” as Joy likes to call them, into our products was our way of adding even more nutritional benefit to our snacks.  


**Keepin’ it real**  
As it has always been, we do not use anything artificial—be it sweeteners, colors or preservatives. We even avoid zero-calorie substitutes like stevia and monk fruit (the science is not totally clear on these yet, and we like to be conservative), and stay away from sugar alcohols like xylitol or sorbitol altogether. We’re just keepin’ it real, using clean ingredients that taste incredible and add a nutritive benefit to your diet.  

Joy has really outdone herself this time. She’s made our snacks even cleaner and more delicious than they were before. These changes reflect who we are—an innovative snack company trying to do better and be better every day. We are offering the best-tasting bites on our mission to help people snack purposefully and feel great. We are transforming healthy snacking from something that often feels like a sacrifice into something that is now a *nourishing indulgence*.
