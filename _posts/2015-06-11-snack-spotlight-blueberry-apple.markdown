In the mood for a skinny treat? Snag some of our [Blueberry Apple](/snacks/blueberry-apple/) granola bites that are subtly sweet, fun to eat and happen to be healthy, too!

We start with whole grain oats, blueberries, apples, crisp brown rice, and chia seeds, roll them together and bake them ever so slightly to create chewy, mess-free granola bites.

Each serving of these flavorful gems contains just 100 calories of brag-worthy booty. Check it out.

1. **Oats** are rich in soluble fiber and special antioxidants called tocotrienols that interfere with cholesterol synthesis (meaning, they help lower LDL cholesterol). Fiber helps you stay satiated and be less likely to overeat, helping you keep a trim… err… booty.

2. **Blueberries** are oozing with antioxidants called flavanoids that help reduce inflammation and protect against free radical damage to neurons in the brain, actually improving your memory. Don’t forget it.

3. **Apples** contain plant compounds that may have some serious health benefits, including fibers that block cholesterol absorption, and antioxidants that prevent cellular damage caused by free radicals.

You won’t find any artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives. And, because they’re peanut-free (and because kids go crazy for them) they’re the perfect lunchbox toss-in. They also make a great topper for fro-yo, Greek yogurt…even oatmeal!
