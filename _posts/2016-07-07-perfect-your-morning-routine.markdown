The best mornings are slow and leisurely. Mornings where you can enjoy a cup of coffee or tea and a newspaper or your favorite book. However those mornings, for most of us, are few and far between. They usually look hectic, rushed, and often chaotic which can lead us to make unhealthy decisions. We caught up with Jessica Marcus, RD, on how to perfect your morning routine.

Mornings are my thing. And breakfast is by far my favorite (and biggest) meal. My am routine is like a choreographed dance that at this point I could do in my sleep—and with two little boys, I definitely have! There are a few rules I follow to make sure my morning flows …

1. Sip a cup of hot water with lemon. I do this as I’m prepping breakfast (pre-coffee). I love this ritual, because it’s a soothing, cleansing way to break the fast and start my day out on a healthy foot. Lemon is alkalizing and helps to balance the effects of acidic foods like meat and sugar. It also helps stimulate digestive enzymes to help get things moving in that department.

2. Make protein a priority. A protein rich breakfast will keep you fuller longer so you won’t be tempted by the plethora of pastries you’ll face on your commute to the office. My perfect breakfast is sautéed spinach, 2 eggs and 1/4 avocado served with a side of berries (and black coffee!). My husband and kids are all about the grains, so I’ll do whole grain toast with nut butter, oatmeal with milk and frozen blueberries, or whole grain pancakes with berries and a little drizzle of maple syrup. And I always have easy grab ‘n go options like frozen breakfast bean burritos, Greek yogurt, or fruit & nut bars for those particularly crazy mornings.

3. Pack (and commit to eating) a hearty snack. I use snacking as an asset. I find that if I plan to snack twice a day, I don’t feel the need to gorge myself to 110% fullness at breakfast and lunch. Being well fueled gives me brain power, leaving me much more clear headed and able to make smart food choices all day long. A handful (20-30) of almonds, a container of Greek yogurt, or (obviously) a bag of [Nourish Snacks](/snacks/) is usually just right.

4. Wake up happy. I wish I could remember where I learned this because it was literally life changing. Happiness is a state of mind and therefore a choice you can make every single day. The act of smiling starts a chemical reaction in the body and literally makes you happier. Regardless of what’s happening in life or on the news, I put (or force!) a smile on my face every morning. Similarly, we end the day with our boys by sharing what we’re grateful for. We all have our struggles, but there’s a lot more good than bad.

Now if I could just get into the habit of choosing my outfit the night before I could probably get out the door in half the time!
