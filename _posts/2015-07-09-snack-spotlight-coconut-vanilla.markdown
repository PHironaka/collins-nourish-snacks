What’s the secret behind Joy Bauer’s favorite snack? We combine perfectly toasted coconut with premium oats and silky vanilla, for an irresistible crunch that’s like love at first bite. Unlike traditional granola, our recipe is formed (by oompa loompas, of course) into bite-sized balls. It’s a mess-free way to enjoy a sweet treat that – at only 120 calories – tastes like a dessert.

**3 reasons to snack on Coconut Vanilla:**

1. **Oats** are overflowing with fiber (a heroic hunger-curber) and tocotrienols, powerful antioxidants that help lower LDL cholesterol by interfering with cholesterol synthesis.

2. **Chia seeds** contain a brag-worthy amount of omega-3 fats, protein, soluble fiber, and antioxidants. This chic superfood helps to reduce inflammation, control blood clotting, and fortify brain cells.

3. **Coconut** is bursting with healthy fats, including lauric acid, which helps increase “good” HDL cholesterol levels.

**Looking for other sneaky ways to feed your (healthy) addiction?**

Fill a baked apple or peach with [Coconut Vanilla granola bites](/snacks/coconut-vanilla/) for a tropical treat, make your own crunchy yogurt parfait, mix with a batch of light popcorn, or crush a few and sprinkle on French toast.
