Let’s face it, most kids are picky eaters, so packing a school lunch bag that will entice your kiddos and satisfy your health standards can be somewhat challenging. Here’s a simple formula to make your morning chaos a little less stressful.

A healthy lunch box = a protein entree, a produce item, a fun snack, and a water bottle.

**1. Incorporate PROTEIN for energy and focus**

Try filling up a thermos with warm options like hearty soups, chili, or leftover taco meat. When it comes to cold options, couple a container of Greek yogurt with small bags of toppers (try berries and granola) or make “sandwich pinwheels” by layering a whole grain tortilla wrap with lettuce, sliced turkey and cheese… then simply roll it up and slice into rounds.

**2. Add PRODUCE for vitamins, minerals and antioxidants**

When it comes to produce, the more the merrier. Make a preferred list with your children and use this inside information; apples, clementines, bell pepper sticks, baby carrots, sugar snap peas, cherry tomatoes, berries and grapes seem to be popular kid-friendly picks.

**3. Toss in a FUN SNACK for smiles**

Anything goes — keep it portion-controlled and under 200 calories. Extra credit if your snack provides protein, fiber or other key nutrients. Try a pudding cup, 2 oatmeal cookies, or a single-serve pack of [Nourish Snacks granola bites](/snacks/).

**4. Encourage WATER for hydration**

Juices (even 100% fruit juice) are loaded with simple sugars that spike the blood sugar, leading to afternoon energy crashes. If your kiddo isn’t a fan of plain H20, try naturally flavored seltzers or add a few pieces of fresh or frozen fruit to their water bottle for a hint of flavor.

**Want bonus points, parents?**

Involve your kids in the packing ritual. They’ll feel empowered and in charge of the selection— plus you’ll get to spend some quality time together. #theygrowuptoofast
