**Bananas**   
*Their sweet versatility and perfect portability make them the ultimate low calorie snack. No wonder they’re America’s favorite fruit! But bananas are more than just a delicious, healthy treat, they are immune-system mavens packed with nutrients that can increase your body’s ability to fight off pathogens.*

**Potassium Party**  
Bananas are an absolute goldmine when it comes to potassium. The mineral supports bone health, proper muscle function and helps maintain blood pressure. With over 400 mg per serving, one medium sized banana contains about 20% of your daily recommended intake. It’s no wonder people go bananas for them!

**Packing a Punch**  
This nutritional powerhouse touts many other health benefits such as being rich vitamin B6 and fiber. Bananas also tend to be easy on the digestive tract and can be a great option for people with sensitive stomachs.

They provide about 100 calories and 27 grams of carbs per 1 medium sized banana, and pair wonderfully with nut butters to provide the perfect energy-rich snack for an active lifestyle.

**Bananas Galore**  
Bananas are a versatile star in the kitchen as well making their way into a variety of treats.
