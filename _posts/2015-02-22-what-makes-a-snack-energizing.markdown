Whether you missed breakfast or need a tasty afternoon pick me up, we’ve got you covered with energizing ingredients that’ll kick you into high gear!

**Protein** is digested slowly for sustained and lasting energy. Foods rich in protein (think: chickpeas, edamame, peanuts and almonds) are loaded with amino acids that fuel your metabolism (aka your internal engine).

**Fiber** – found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds and legumes – helps stabilize your blood sugar levels, while adding bulk to food which keeps you feeling full. And while your body can’t actually digest fiber for fuel, fiber absorbs (and then excretes) waste and metabolic junk throughout its digestive journey, leaving you feeling lighter and more nimble.

**Combine protein AND fiber,** and you’ve got a winning formula that satisfies hunger, prevents dips in blood sugar, increases focus and boosts your energy. (See ya, brain fog. Hello Richard Simmons-like stamina)
