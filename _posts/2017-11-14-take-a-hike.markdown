Be it because of the clean, crisp air, the mild and pleasant weather, or the promise of phenomenal leaf peeping, hiking is perennially a favorite Fall activity. So many of us are cooped up indoors for 30…40…50 hours a week, and a weekend hike is the perfect excuse to get some fresh air, catch some breathtaking views, and incorporate a little exercise. After all, winter is coming! So grab some friends, explore a new path (we love <a href="https://www.llbean.com/parkfinder/" target="_blank">L.L.Bean’s ParkFinder</a>), and don’t forget to pack the snacks.
