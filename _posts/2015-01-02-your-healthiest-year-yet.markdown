Looking to gain better health in 2016? While it’s easy to let big, overarching resolutions fizzle out, Nourish Snacks founder, Joy Bauer, breaks it down for you with 5 measurable actions so that real change can happen.

Joy’s goals for eating smarter in this year are both inspiring and completely doable:

**1. Amp up your produce**

Vegetables and fruit are high in volume, low in calories and packed with vitamins, so they provide a worthy nutritional bang for your buck.

**2. Dine in—at least three nights a week** 

Preparing your own meals (versus calling for takeout), puts you in control over what goes into your food and what stays out. Joy’s cooking secret? Triple your recipes and freeze the leftovers in portion-controlled containers so you’ll have easy access to healthy, home-cooked meals when you’re short on time.

**3. Sweat it out—daily**

Exercising for a half hour every day actually benefits your diet, because it puts you in the mindset to make healthy food choices as you go about your routine.

**4. Snack smart**

When you munch on the wrong snacks, you end up hungry, cranky and tired. The perfect snack should be no more than 200 calories and contain protein and/or fiber. Obviously, [Nourish Snacks](/snacks/) always hit the mark!

**5. Forgive and forge forward**

We can’t expect to be perfect 24/7—In fact practically everyone falls off the wagon from time to time. If and when that happens, simply shake it off and move on.
