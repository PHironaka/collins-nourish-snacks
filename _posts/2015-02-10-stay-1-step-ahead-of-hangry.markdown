**The science of hangry**

Waiting too long between meals without eating a high-quality snack causes blood sugar levels to dip, leaving you feeling tired, cranky and hungry—AKA hangry.

Another entrance to hangry-ville? When you’re dieting—and restrictive with food choices—and your office mate orders the most delicious-looking burger and fries.

**Symptoms**

Anger, irritability, headache, death stares.

**Rx**

Eat food. Immediately.

**Stay one step ahead of “the hangry”**

Don’t wait until you’re starving to eat. Avoid the emotional roller coaster (and keep your friends and job!) by stashing a few good-for-you snacks in your bag or desk drawer… and dig in when you first start to feel hungry.
