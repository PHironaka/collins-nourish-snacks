New Years resolutions are all fun and games until life gets in the way. When the initial hype has died down around those lofty goals, stick to our helpful tips for some of the most common resolutions out there, and you’ll be more likely to keep them going for longer.

***Your resolution: To drink more water***

1. **Buy a big water bottle** in a design and color that you love so that you’re more likely to bring it with you everywhere you go.
2. Tired of regular old agua? **Add lemon or frozen berries** to your water to give it some flavor and excitement.
3. **Drinking 1/2 your body weight in ounces of H20** is a good rule of thumb, but the reality is we all live in different climates and have unique activity levels. The best way to determine your hydration status is to monitor the color of your…er… urine. If it’s mellow yellow, you’re sipping wisely.  


***Your resolution: To practice portion control***

1. **Order 1-2 appetizer portions** when out at a restaurant. It’s less food… but for less money. You didn’t need to eat the oversized dinner portion anyway.
2. **Downsize dishes.** When you eat at home, serve your meals on smaller plates. Appropriate portions will look more substantial on smaller dishes, and you’ll likely be satisfied with less food.
3. **Snack smarter.** Pour snacks from larger packages into a small bowl before eating. You’ll consume less than if you had munched right out of the bag. Or go for portion-controlled snacks—either homemade (whip up a trail mix and divide into small zip-top bags) or store-bought ( like your favorite flavor of [Nourish Snacks](/snacks/) ). 

  
***Your resolution: To get back on the exercise train***

1. No time to hit the gym? **Wake up 10 minutes earlier** three mornings per week and complete a quick at-home workout. It might not seem like a lot, but when done on a regular basis, it adds up!
2. **Add workouts into your calendar.** Seeing it pop up in daily schedule will make you more likely to follow through and less likely to make plans if the time is already accounted for.  


***Your resolution: To clean up your diet***

1. **Keep a food journal.** Jotting down what, when and how much you eat for a few days can provide valuable insight into what you’re actually eating each day.
2. **Find non-food rewards.** Instead of eating indulgent foods because “you deserve it,” think of other noncaloric ways to reward yourself like a pampering pedicure, a new exercise class, or a relaxing massage.
3. **Snack on this.** Snacks account for, on average, 24% of your daily calories, so find clean versions of your favorites to keep you satisfied throughout the day. Shameless plug: [Nourish Snacks](/snacks/) are made with nutrient-rich ingredients and also taste super delicious!
