As soon as we found out December is National Pear Month, we had to share this super easy and super delicious recipe for Spiced Baked Pears! A great use for the pear tree that partridge came with ;)

**Spiced Baked Pears**

**Ingredients**  
2 ripened Bosc pears  
Dash of cinnamon and nutmeg  
1 package of Nourish Snacks® Chewy Blueberry Apple Granola Bites (4 oz package)  
Non-fat baking spray  
16 oz vanilla nonfat Greek or traditional yogurt  

*Total time: 35 minutes – Yields 4 servings*

**Directions**  
*Step 1:*  Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.

*Step 2:*  Halve the 2 ripened pears, remove the cores and stems, and scoop out the centers with a melon baller, being careful not to scoop too deeply so as to pierce through to the skin of the pear.

*Step 3:*  Sprinkle the halves with cinnamon and nutmeg.

*Step 4:*  Insert the Nourish Snacks® Chewy Blueberry Apple Granola Bites into the cavity you’ve just scooped out. We fit about 4-5 bites in each half.

*Step 5:*  Lightly mist the pears with baking spray.

*Step 6:*  Fill a baking dish with about ½ cup of water (to maintain the moisture of the pears), and place the 4 halves into the dish.

*Step 7:*  Bake for 20-25 minutes.

*Step 8:*  Serve each pear with a couple of dollops (about 4 oz) of vanilla yogurt (Greek or traditional) and enjoy!
