main_text: Throughout her successful career Joy has been fortunate enough to work
  with extraordinary kids, teens, and young adults from all walks of life, teaching
  them how to eat right, stay active, and lead a healthy lifestyle.  In fact, Joy
  often says that one of her most rewarding experiences was with “Heart Smart Kids,”
  a health program she created and implemented for underprivileged children living
  in Harlem. Here at Nourish, we aim to continue her work by nourishing young bodies—and
  minds. This year we’re partnering with Alliance for a Healthier Generation in our
  common interest to fight childhood obesity and help kids develop healthy habits
  from a young age. Make a Difference with <a href="https://www.healthiergeneration.org"
